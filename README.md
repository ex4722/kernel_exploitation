# kernel Exploitation

Learning about kernel exploitation and heres a good place to dump information and notes. 


## Kernel for CTF's
- https://speakerdeck.com/yuawn/kernel-exploitation?slide=1 ( Slides in Chinese but goldmine of commands ) \
- https://github.com/smallkirby/kernelpwn Past CTF examples
- [3 Part writeup](https://lkmidas.github.io/posts/20210123-linux-kernel-pwn-part-1/) Gradually builds up protections and great 
explanation

## Starting Commands:


## Kernel Heap overflow

## TODO:
- Learn how to use c instead of pwn tools
- Figure out how to build a kernel with debug
- Figure out gdb step and breakpoint bug

## Part 1: Barebone Basics
- SMEP is like NX, Kept in CR4 register, overwriting is possible but sometimes its pinned 
- SMAP and KTPI isolates the pages
- `iretq` to exit kernel mode, stack like this `RIP|CS|RFLAGS|SP|SS`
  - Call `swapgs` before to switch kernel/user mode bit
- Without SMAP stack pivioting is just a matter of picking a gadget to move a value into rsp and then mmaping that memory
- KTPI crashes in userspace as pages are kernels pages
    - Register `SIGSEGV` signal handler to call shell despite being in NX pages
    - `KPTI trampoline` swap pages and calls iretq and swagps `swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode()
- `ksymtab_FUNCTION` struct has name and offset from struct 
- `modprobe_path` string to executeable when executing unknown file types
    - Overwrite path with shell, execute file with \xff, win
